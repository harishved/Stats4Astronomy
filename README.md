# Stats4Astronomy
Lecture notes and example code for my Undergraduate Statistics course taught in the fall of 2024 (Sept to Nov) at the Astronomy department of the University of Groningen. 

The course consists of 4hr per week of lectures and 2-4hr per week of tutorials. It ran for 8 weeks. 
The students learn the theoretical concepts in the lectures and get hands-on implementation in the tutorials (mostly with python)
I am only posting the material from the lectures for the moment. I taught the concepts using many examples, some drawn from the world of astronomy and others from life in general.
I am also posting the python code that I used to numerically solve the astrophysical statistical problems posed in the notes. 

The best way for a student of statistics to benefit from this material is to read the notes first and then go into the code to peruse the implementation of the methods described in the notes. The code is poorly commented, but I will improve that as and when I find the time. Most of the figures in the notes are outputs of the code. 

The course was taught by [Prof. Scott Trager](https://www.rug.nl/staff/s.c.trager/?lang=en) before I took over. I did not alter the syllabus of the course much. So credit is due to Scott for the formulation of the syllabus. 
The recommended additional reading for the course was "Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial" by Silvia and Skilling, which is also a hold-over from Scott's course. I did not use the material in the book to formulate my notes, so the notes stand apart. However, the selection of topics covered do have some influence from the topics in the book, so I credit it here.

The code examples are implemented with python3 and use the python packages: math, [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [scipy](https://scipy.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [corner](https://corner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
The plots in the notes were rendered using a matplotlibrc file that was based on the [suggestions of Monica Turner](https://turnermoni.ca/python3.html)

## I found a mistake
This is to be expected. I learnt that I was going to teach the course far too late, which meant that I was typing up my notes and codes during the 8-week course (under some time pressure) so I have managed to produce an unpolished yet useful piece of work. Please communicate these errors to me and any other suggestions for improvement at vedantham at astron dot nl and I will be very grateful.

## The tone used in the notes seems .... different?
The notes use an informal tone and in some places may even read like a popular book meant for a lay audience. This is a deliberate choice as I feel that textbooks/notes for undergraduates should use an inviting language while being rigorous at the same time. Several students in my course came up to tell me that they really like these notes, so I think I am on to something here.
